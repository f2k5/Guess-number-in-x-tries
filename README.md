# Guess-number-in-x-tries
The computer is thinking of a number between 1 to 100. Challenge the computer that you can guess the number in x tries. If you can guess the number before you hit x tries you win. After each try you will be given a hint "lower" - if the number is lower and "higher" - if the number is higher.
